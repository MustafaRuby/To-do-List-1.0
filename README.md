Hi! This is your own to do list app, here's how you can use it.

Event insertion:
To insert you write the details about the event you want to plan (if you don't insert any details, you will not be able to insert any event). 
Then you can add a date to your plan, if you don't, it'll automatically set the date to the day you inserted it on.

To add an event to the list, you can click the "Add event" button, or click "Enter" while in the input or date feild.

List use:
To check events that you already completed, either click on the checkbox or the event itself.

To eliminate the events you checked you can either click the "Remove checked events" buttons or simply press the "Backspace" or "delete" key.

To check all the elements simply press "Ctrl+A".

To clear the list click the "Clear list" button.
